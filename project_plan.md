## ❓ Key Questions
1. Who are the most valuable customers (by frequency, recency, and spend)?
2. What are the top-selling products and categories?
3. What causes the most order cancellations or returns?
4. Which states/cities generate the most revenue?
5. How long does it typically take for orders to get delivered?

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies
- Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn)
- SQL (PostgreSQL or SQLite)
- Power BI or Tableau for dashboards
- GitHub for version control and documentation

## 🗓️ Timeline
